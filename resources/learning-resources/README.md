# Learning resources

This is a curated collection of resources which are useful to explore Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

If you are wondering where to start please have a look [here](../where-to-start.md).

## Coursera Machine Learning

[Coursera Machine Learning course](Coursera%20Machine%20Learning.md) provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. It is mainly theoretical (even if there are some practical projects to develop in Matlab), so it is a good starting point if you are really at the beginning of your learning on ML/DL.

## Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

[Coursera Deep Learning Specialization course](Coursera%20Deep%20Learning%20Specialization.md) is a compilation of courses specialized in DL. You will build and train Neural Network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. 

## Machine learning mastery

[Machine learning mastery](Machine%20learning%20mastery.md) is a great website containing tons of articles and tutorials covering almost any basic aspect of neural networks and deep learning, with great examples and code implementations.

## MIT 6.S191 - Intro to deep learning

[MIT 6.S191](MIT%206.S191%20-%20Intro%20to%20deep%20learning.md) is a really high quality course from MIT which covers the basics of deep learning without delving too much into the math. It's really good to get a first overall view of the field, understanding the basic concepts and the most used structures.

## Stanford ML and DL cheatsheets

[These cheatsheets](Stanford%20ML%20and%20DL%20cheatsheets.md) are collections of quick concepts, examples and brief explanations related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep Learning.

## StatQuest

[StatQuest](StatQuest.md) is a YouTube channel providing almost 200 videos on various topics regarding statistics, machine learning and deep learning.  
The videos have a very slow pace, introducing all necessary content or linking to previous videos where prerequisites have already been presented in more detail. The maths are presented in detail although without many formalisms (the concepts are presented in order to require only very basic math prerequisites).

## W3Schools Python reference

[W3Schools](W3Schools%20Python%20reference.md) is a website which contains lots of examples and references for various programming languages, including Python.

## WU T81 558 - Applications of Deep Neural Networks

[WU T81 558](WU%20T81%20558%20-%20Applications%20of%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks.md) is a course heavily focused on programming and a hands-on approach, which can be very useful to start. It has almost no prerequisites since the first modules cover both the basics of Python and of deep learning, however deep learning concepts are only summarily presented and some previous theoretical knowledge is advised.
