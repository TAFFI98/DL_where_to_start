# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This specialization course is formed by 5 courses which deepen different topics in the field of Deep Learning.
- In the **first course** of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of **neural networks and deep learning**. 
- In the **second course** of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will open the deep learning black box to **understand the processes** that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 
- In the **third course** of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will learn how to build a successful **machine learning project** and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. 
- In the **fourth course** of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will understand how **computer vision** has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.
- In the **fifth course** of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will become familiar with **sequence models** and their exciting applications such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing (NLP), and more.

## Topics

 • Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications

• Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow

• Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning

• Build a Convolutional Neural Network, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data

• Build and train Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering
